# phace

Reverse engineering OSX/macOS `*.photoslibrary` format. Primary goal is to
export face tagging data from the embedded databases.

## Status

This project is very much a work in progress still. Additionally, Apple appears to have made significant changes to the `*.photoslibrary` directory structure in macOS 10.15 Catalina. Phace is unlikely to work on the newer versions.
